										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Hetrick Wins ATV MX Kick-Off at Daytona Intl. Speedway; Rastrelli on Podium; Johnson Wins WORCS Pro Stock SxS</h2>
<p align="left">Joel Hetrick showed the competition how it’s done at the <a href="https://atvmotocross.com/">ATV MX National Championship</a> season opener, winning the overall at the iconic Daytona International Speedway. CST Tires’ Jeffrey Rastrelli joined him on the podium in third place.</p>
<p align="left"><figure id="attachment_11944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-11944" style="width: 1385px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-11944" src="https://www.csttires.com/us/files/2022/03/Joel.jpg" alt="ATV racer kicking up dirt" width="1385" height="942" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-11944" class="wp-caption-text">Joel Hetrick</figcaption></figure></p>
<p align="left">Both athletes rode <a href="https://www.csttires.com/us/tire/pulse-mxr/">CST Pulse MXR</a> tires to the ATV MX podium. “I am so happy with my performance today and my team as well,” Hetrick said on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca3mBhcOOfw/">Instagram</a>. “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/phxracingatv/">@phxracingatv</a> had my quad dialed in all day long despite the conditions. Grabbing the fastest qualifier, a heat race win and the main event win felt amazing! The emotions were real today after the main event. I’ve had some bad runs at Daytona, but today, I felt different. All of the training and riding <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deckertrainingfacility/">@deckertrainingfacility</a> was such a huge help for this race. Had a great battle most of the race until I was able to make it to the lead and bring home the win! Things don’t always go as planned, but I told myself going into this race I was going to win, and I did just that. Such a crazy start to the 2022 race season, but I am thankful to come out of this race healthy and on top. Time to go back to work for Round 2!!”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Rastrelli was also thrilled with his WORCS Daytona results. “Stoked to leave <a href="https://www.instagram.com/daytona/">@daytona</a> on the box! The track was very hard to pass on and rough. I struggled a bit halfway through the main event but started to turn it around at the end. We have some things to work on, but I am happy to leave with a podium. Back to work and onto Texas! Thank you so much to everyone that came to support me yesterday! It was amazing to see how many people came to support me from friends to family.. thank you!” he said on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Ca4tzLFrMyt/">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p align="left">Hetrick’s win is the latest in a string of victories for CST athletes, who topped three podiums at WORCS Round 3. Chris Johnson took a victory in SxS, winning the Pro Stock class, while Beau Baron won the Pro race and later made another trip to the top of the podium when he took first place in SxS Pro Production. Ryan Piplic did well in the Mint 400, taking sixth place in UTV Pro Turbo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left"><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />After a devastating knee injury kept him away from racing for more than eight months, Brycen Neal’s return to the GNCC alone would have been reason to celebrate. But in a scenario straight out of a movie, Neal took the victory at that first race, winning the VP Racing Fuels Big Buck GNCC Round 1 in Union South Carolina.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Fifth away from the starting line, Neal worked his way to third by the third lap, with only .4 seconds separating him from the front runners. Riding neck-and-neck with the other riders for most of the final lap, Neal gained an advantage in the final corners to take the win.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Neal’s injury at a GNCC race in May 2021 required surgery the following month to repair his ACL and meniscus, and his Instagram post after the race reflected his joy at getting back to competition. “Words can barely describe this one. After eight and a half months off of racing, I’m so pumped to grab the win at my first <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gncc_racing/">GNCC race</a> back! It’s been such a long grind to get back to this point to compete. But I’m excited for the weeks ahead to get back to work and improve,” he said. “After not racing for that long I made some silly mistakes and I’m still not where I want to be, but I’m just so dang happy to be racing again! I appreciate the love and support of everyone. It was so great to see everybody at the races again! Onto the next one.”</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">He was almost as thrilled with his CST tires. “Couldn’t have done it today without my <a href="https://www.csttires.com/us/tire/pulse-ht/">Pulse HT</a>s!” said Neal. The Pulse HT was designed with input from CST’s athletes and is versatile enough to hook up in almost any terrain.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">The next <a href="https://gnccracing.com/events">GNCC Presented by Specialized</a> race, the Moose Racing Wild Boar, is scheduled for March 5-6 in Palatka, Florida.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">Anne Tauber will spend the run-up to the 2021 Olympics riding with her CST PostNL Bafang MTB Racing teammates. Tauber, who has ridden with the team since 2018, has signed for an additional two years, through 2021-2022.  She was the first mountain biker to qualify for next year’s Dutch Olympic team, clinching her spot at last year’s UCI XCO World Cup in Albstadt, Germany.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">CST PostNL Bafang director Bart Brentjens is pleased that she’s staying with the team: “Our team’s sportive ambition is still to win a medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021…The Olympic Games 2024 in Paris are still a long way off, but also in both our view and intention to work towards together. As we look back, Anne made and is still making enormous progression as a professional mountain biker. With her mentality, she has the capacity to [be one of] the best mountain bikers of the world…Anne is a very positive spirit. Anne knows how to focus and to set goals. She has character and is able to deal with all kinds of circumstances. We are happy to follow our Olympic road together,” said Brentjens.    </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Tauber is just as pleased to extend her time with CST PostNL Bafang. “The team has offered me everything I could ask for, and we have been working together in a great atmosphere; it really feels like a family to me,” she said. “The results of the past two years have proven that the cooperation between us is successful…Even though the current circumstances concerning Covid-19 are difficult, we can move forward and focus on what is important to us: making progress! And of course, our ultimate goal is set in Tokyo in 2021!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">This year&#8217;s grueling Ultra Bike Marathon in Szklarska Poręba, Poland featured nearly 100 km. of riding at an elevation of almost 3500 m. Beautiful mountain scenery, a strong starting line-up and a well-organized race, despite the current restrictions, all favored a spirited competition. The CST 7R team picked up the gauntlet and started the race last Saturday shortly after 9:00. After more than five hours of all-out cycling, Karol Rożek crossed the finish line first, almost a minute ahead of Wojciech Halejak and Mariusz Kozak from the JBG-2 Cryospace team.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">&#8220;The season has finally begun! The race in Szklarska Poręba is an extremely demanding route, a long distance and fast-paced from the very start. After almost nine months&#8217; break from racing, this year&#8217;s bike marathon was the first opportunity for me to check my physical shape, which makes me more than pleased with my first place. I would like to thank the guys from JBG2 for the fierce competition. Also, many thanks to the event organizers for their great management of the race,&#8221; said Rożek.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Despite some problems on the route, Michał Kucewicz also achieved a good result, completing the GIGA distance. Kucewicz took tenth place in the open classification and third in his age category.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">&#8220;As for the beginning of the season, I must admit that it was tough in Szklarska. The route was very demanding, with not only many hard uphills, but also technical downhills, which gave me a hard time. The Giants&#8217; Bicycle Range [Pasmo Rowerowe Olbrzymy] is a great option. I didn&#8217;t think I would like these singletracks so much. I had several problems on the route. Fortunately, nothing happened to me and the bike. Congratulations to Karol, who won on Saturday. I’m not surprised at all,&#8221; said Kucewicz.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Michał Ficek finished the marathon in 12th place in open classification and 8th in the elite category. Although he had hoped for a better outcome, he remains optimistic and determined.</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;Regarding the positives of my cycling: I crossed the finish line in one piece and somehow finished in eighth place in the elite. I am still tired after last weekend, my legs are not strong enough, [and my] stomach [is] upset, but there is no point in getting into details. The most important matters: it is great to go to the race in a positive atmosphere, not worry about the service and buffet, and if you are in need, you can even borrow a bike. It is great to be part of the CST 7R MTB Team! Now, it is time to start training to be better prepared for the next races,&#8221; said Ficek.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">Team member Oliwier Machura did well in the M1 category, taking fifth place.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="left">After winning their season’s first competition, the members of CST 7R are focused on training and are optimistic about their upcoming races.</p>

<p align="left">Ryan Piplic rode CST’s <a href="https://www.csttires.com/us/tire/apache/">Apache</a> tires to third place at Best in the Desert’s King Shocks Laughlin Desert Classic. Piplic raced the Pro Turbo class at the nighttime race, held February 20 in Laughlin, Nevada.</p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 20px;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial, sans-serif;color: #000000" align="left"><span style="font-size: 9pt;line-height: 18px;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10231" src="https://www.csttires.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Harlen-Foley-9K9A1543-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1706" /> </span></p>
<p align="left">Piplic, who finished the grueling course in 2:29:16.677, was pleased with the Apache’s performance. “I made the switch to CST this year, and we found the new Apache tire was going to be the ultimate tire for Best in the Desert racing,” he said. “The amount of traction and resistance to punctures is next level. We started and finished on the same four 30-inch Apaches, and not one problem. After the race they still look like new and ready to go for the next race. Game changer!” Specifically designed to tackle the challenges of desert riding, the <a href="https://www.csttires.com/us/tire/apache/">Apache</a> features steel-belted 8-ply rated radial construction and excellent puncture-resistance, while delivering solid grip and steady cornering through berms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two years ago, the term “gravel bike” had barely come into use; now, there’s nary a shop that hasn’t encountered &#8211; and even embraced &#8211; the category. Word of this “new” sport is spreading quickly among cyclists &#8211; from those whose friends are inviting them to their first gravel grinders, to those who are drawn to the appeal of a car-free riding experience that’s not hard-core mountain biking.</p>
<p>To go along with the explosion in gravel bikes, one of the fastest growing segments in bicycle sales currently, CST Tires has developed three gravel-worthy new products, the Detour, Convoy, Tirent tires, all of which were introduced at Interbike 2018 last month in Reno. These models join the CST Pika, a longstanding favorite. Read on for descriptions and availability information:</p>
<p>The CST Pika tire is a dirt road tire that’s built for the changing terrain of a weekend gravel tour, or even a commute. It features ramped center knobs and U-shaped shoulder knobs, the combination of which allow for fast, smooth forward riding and confidence and traction when turning. Available in 700&#215;38 with a wire bead, the CST Pika is equipped with dual compound tread. It features CST’s Exceptional Puncture Safety (EPS) technology, which is a layer of poly-fiber material between the tread and casing that prevents objects from penetrating the casing to puncture the tube.</p>
<p>The newly launched CST Tirent is a 700x40c dirt and gravel tire designed in the most popular width for gravel riding. Based on CST’s B-Fast mountain bike tire and also equipped with dual compound tread, the Tirent is a performance-minded tire with a tread pattern that offers low rolling resistance for enhanced speed. Its shoulder knobs are spaced apart more widely for traction. The Tirent has a wire bead and it also features CST’s EPS technology. </p>
<p>Coming to market in early 2019, the brand new CST Detour tire is great for hard-packed dirt roads and pathways. It’s a fast-rolling, high-volume and lightweight tire that’s a perfect complement to a commuter or gravel bicycle. A reflective sidewall stripe helps make the rider more visible and ensures greater safety in low light conditions. The Detour, offered in 700x38c sizing, also features wire bead and dual compound tread. The tread pattern is great for traction in wet conditions, whether riding on dirt, grass, or pavement.</p>
<p>Finally, the CST Convoy tire rounds out the 2019 offerings from CST. The Convoy is a tire that’s engineered for the new generation of versatile all-road and gravel bikes and it has optimized tread across three different widths: 32, 38, and 50c. The tread pattern has evenly spaced knobs for a consistent and connected feel in a range of conditions from “kitty litter” gravel to chunky stone. As with its gravel siblings, the Convoy tire features a wire bead and CST’s EPS technology.</p>
<p>CST Tires are available from all major bike shop distributors. The Detour, Convoy, Pika and Tirent are a low-cost and high-impact tire solution for your gravel-riding customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">Mitch Anderson clinched WORCS’ Pro 2 championship with a third-place race finish at Round 9, the final race of the season, and easily won the Open A title as well. Beau Baron took second place in the Pro ATV race as well as second place for the year, and won the SxS Pro Stock championship. WORCS’ Round 9 was held October 26-28 in Primm, Nevada.</p>
<p align="left">Anderson took a spot on the podium at every Pro 2 WORCS race this year, and took a victory at Round 3. He racked up a total of 152 points in 2018.</p>
<p align="left"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9987" src="https://www.csttires.com/us/files/2018/11/Harlen-Foley-DM0A7734-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></p>
<p align="left">In Open A, Anderson earned the championship by winning five of the six races in which he competed, including the season finale. He accumulated 141 points, 17 more than the second-place rider, by the season’s end, and also took second place overall in 450 A. “My program wouldn’t be where it is without CST tires,” he said. “A lot of credit goes to CST for sticking with me this year.”</p>
<p align="left"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9985" src="https://www.csttires.com/us/files/2018/11/Harlen-Foley-884A3493-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></p>
<p align="left">Baron finished the season just one point away from first place in Pro ATV standings. He took four wins and turned in three second-place finishes this year. “One point; that’s all it is,” he said. “I won more races than anyone else this year, but it didn’t work out in my favor. I’m definitely bummed, but we’ll work hard on next year.”</p>
<p align="left">The news was much better for Baron in SxS Pro Stock. After six turns on the podium, including two victories, he took the class championship with a total of 180 points for the year, an eight-point margin over the next rider.</p>
