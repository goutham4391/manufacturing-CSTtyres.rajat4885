I\u2019ve had some bad runs at Daytona, but today, I felt different. All of the training and riding\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/deckertrainingfacility\/\">@deckertrainingfacility<\/a>\u00a0was such a huge help for this race. Had a great battle most of the race until I was able to make it to the lead and bring home the win! Things don\u2019t always go as planned, but I told myself going into this race I was going to win, and I did just that. Such a crazy start to the 2022 race season, but I am thankful to come out of this race healthy and on top.

The track was very hard to pass on and rough. I struggled a bit halfway through the main event but started to turn it around at the end. We have some things to work on, but I am happy to leave with a podium. Back to work and onto Texas! Thank you so much to everyone that came to support me yesterday!
