Beautiful mountain scenery, a strong starting line-up and a well-organized race, despite the current restrictions, all favored a spirited competition. The CST 7R team picked up the gauntlet and started the race last Saturday shortly after 9:00. After more than five hours of all-out cycling, Karol Ro\u017cek crossed the finish line first, almost a minute ahead of Wojciech Halejak and Mariusz Kozak from the JBG-2 Cryospace team.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&#8220;The season has finally begun! The race in Szklarska Por\u0119ba is an extremely demanding route, a long distance and fast-paced from the very start. After almost nine months&#8217; break from racing, this year&#8217;s bike marathon was the first opportunity for me to check my physical shape, which makes me more than pleased with my first place. I would like to thank the guys from JBG2 for the fierce competition. Also, many thanks to the event organizers for their great management of the race,&#8221; said Ro\u017cek.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Despite some problems on the route, Micha\u0142 Kucewicz also achieved a good result, completing the GIGA distance. Kucewicz took tenth place in the open classification and third in his age category.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&#8220;As for the beginning of the season, I must admit that it was tough in Szklarska. The route was very demanding, with not only many hard uphills, but also technical downhills, which gave me a hard time. The Giants&#8217; Bicycle Range [Pasmo Rowerowe Olbrzymy] is a great option. I didn&#8217;t think I would like these singletracks so much. I had several problems on the route. Fortunately, nothing happened to me and the bike. Congratulations to Karol, who won on Saturday. I\u2019m not surprised at all,&#8221; said Kucewicz.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Micha\u0142 Ficek finished the marathon in 12th place in open classification and 8th in the elite category. Although he had hoped for a better outcome, he remains optimistic and determined.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">&#8220;Regarding the positives of my cycling: I crossed the finish line in one piece and somehow finished in eighth place in the elite. I am still tired after last weekend, my legs are not strong enough, [and my] stomach [is] upset, but there is no point in getting into details. The most important matters: it is great to go to the race in a positive atmosphere, not worry about the service and buffet, and if you are in need, you can even borrow a bike. It is great to be part of the CST 7R MTB Team! Now, it is time to start training to be better prepared for the next races,&#8221; said Ficek.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Team member Oliwier Machura did well in the M1 category, taking fifth place.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">After winning their season\u2019s first competition, the members of CST 7R are focused on training and are optimistic about their upcoming races.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\" align=\"left\">About CST Tires<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;line-height: 20px;font-size: 10pt;font-family: Arial;color: #000000\" align=\"left\">CST brand tires are offered by Cheng Shin Rubber Ind.
